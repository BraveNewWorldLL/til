title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/): 
1. Ruby Koan will serve as a good resource for functions that I have never heard of.
2. assert is to test
3. The if statements are interesting
4. Raise (Exception)

"The code doesn't work."
"Why?"
"The code works.
"Why?"
